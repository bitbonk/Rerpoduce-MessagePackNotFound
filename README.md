The repo demonstrates the a compiler error.

I you build this project you will see the the following compiler error in the WPF project `MessagePackNotFound.UserControlsLib`:

> Microsoft.WinFX.targets(211,9): Error MC1000 : Unknown build error, 'Could not find assembly 'MessagePack, Version=3.1.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b4a0369545f0a1be'. Either explicitly load this assembly using a method such as LoadFromAssemblyPath() or use a MetadataAssemblyResolver that returns a valid assembly.'

This has to do something with the code that is generated by the MessagePack source generators.

- If you downgrade MessagePack from `3.1.4` to `2.5.198` (which did not use source generators), the problem will go away.
- If you remove the attribute `[MessagePackObject(AllowPrivate = true)]` from the `Dto` class in `MessagePackNotFound.CommonLib`, the problem will go away.
- If you remove the private assets element (`<PrivateAssets>Analyzers; Build; ContentFiles; Compile</PrivateAssets>`) from the MessagePack package reference in `MessagePackNotFound.CommonLib.csproj`, the problem will go away.
